## Introduction

This guide outlines how to report vulnerabilities, what qualifies as a responsible disclosure, and how we handle security-related issues.  

We aim to respond quickly to valid reports and maintain clear communication throughout the process.

Whether you're a contributor, researcher, or curious developer, your input helps protect GoDarda's integrity and ensures a safer experience for all.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in GoDarda or any of its related assets (e.g., documentation, scripts, hosted pages), please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/godarda/godarda.github.io/issues) with the label `security`.

Include as much detail as possible:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Any suggested mitigation or fix

We aim to respond within **72 hours** and will keep you updated throughout the process.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- Source code in this repository
- GitHub Pages hosted under `godarda.github.io`
- Contributor documentation and automation scripts

Out of scope:
- Issues related to third-party dependencies unless directly exploitable through GoDarda

## Disclosure Guidelines

We ask that you:
- Please report security issues responsibly. While issues are public by default, we ask that you avoid sharing exploit details in the initial report. This gives us time to investigate and respond appropriately

- Respect privacy and legal boundaries

We commit to:
- Acknowledging valid reports
- Giving credit (if desired) in release notes or acknowledgments
- Keeping communication respectful and transparent
