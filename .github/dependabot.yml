  # Maintain GitHub Actions workflow dependencies
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"

    # Directory containing the workflow files
    directory: "/"

    # Schedule updates to run once a month
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"

    # Configure commit messages to follow semantic conventions
    commit-message:
      prefix: "chore"       # Use 'chore' as the semantic prefix
      include: "scope"      # Include the scope (e.g., 'github-actions') in the message

    # Limit the number of open pull requests to reduce noise
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5

    # Automatically rebase pull requests if there are conflicts
    rebase-strategy: "auto"

    # Target the 'develop' branch for updates

    # Apply labels to pull requests for better visibility and automation
    labels:

      - dependencies        # Identifies the PR as a dependency update
