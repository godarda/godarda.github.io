<p>1. The keyword friend is placed only in the function declaration of the friend function and not in the function definition because it is used to access the member of a class. In simple words, A friend function is a function that has no body inside its base class.<br><br>
2. A friend can be a function, function template, member function, or a class, class template, in which the entire class and all of its members are friends.<br><br>
3. Friend function can access public, private and protected data members of the class for which it is a friend.<br><br>
4. Virtual functions and objects cannot be friends<br><br>
5. Friend functions do not have a this pointer associated with it, because friends are not members of a class.<br><br>
6. Friend of one class can be friend of another class or all the classes in one program, such a friend is known as global friend.<br><br>
7. Friend can be declared anywhere (in public, private or protected section) of class<br><br>
<b>8. Properties of friend function:</b><br>
8.1 Symmetric - if class A is a friend of class B, class B is not automatically a friend of class A. <br>8.2 Transitive - if class A is a friend of class B, and class B is a friend of class C, class A is not automatically a friend of class C. <br>8.3 Inherited - if class Base is a friend of class X, subclass Derived is not automatically a friend of class X; and if class X is a friend of class Base, class X is not automatically a friend of subclass Derived.</p>
