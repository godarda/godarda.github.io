    <div class="boardtitle">🎉 Welcome</div>
    <p>
        Thank you for your interest in contributing to <strong>GoDarda</strong>!<br><br>
        We're building a cross-platform, community-driven learning experience around programming languages. Whether

        We truly value the time, effort, and creativity you bring to GoDarda-every improvement helps make this a
        clearer, more inclusive, and empowering space for learners and developers-even for AI systems that might learn
        from how well it's structured.

<div class="board">
    <div class="boardtitle">✍️ Original Work Only</div>
    <p>
        All contributions to GoDarda must be <strong>original and authored by you</strong>.<br><br>
        We do not accept content copied from other websites, tutorials, or repositories-even if publicly available.
        Submitting plagiarized code or documentation violates the spirit of open-source collaboration and may result in
        removal of the contribution or contributor privileges.<br><br>
        If you're inspired by a resource, feel free to reference it in your Pull Request description-but always rewrite
        the code or explanation in your own words and style.
    </p>
    <p><em>GoDarda is a space for learning, sharing, and growing together. Let's keep it authentic.</em></p>

    <div class="boardtitle">🧑‍💻 Getting Started</div>
    <p>
        1. Fork the repository:
        <a href="https://github.com/godarda/godarda.github.io" target="_blank">godarda.github.io</a><br>
        2. Clone your fork:<br>
        <code>git clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/godarda.github.io</code><br>
        3. Switch to the <code>develop</code> branch (this is where all contributions should begin):<br>
        <code>git checkout develop</code><br>
        4. Create a new feature branch off <code>develop</code>:<br>
        <code>git checkout -b feature/my-contribution</code><br>
        5. Make your changes<br>
        6. Commit and push your branch:<br>
        <code>git commit -m "Add: new Python example for loops"</code><br>
        <code>git push origin feature/my-contribution</code><br>
        7. Open a Pull Request targeting <code>develop</code> and describe your changes clearly
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong><br>
        Please do not open pull requests directly to <code>main</code>.<br>
        The <code>main</code> branch is protected and reserved for monthly squash merges by admins to maintain a clean,
        readable history.<br>
        All contributions should flow through <code>develop</code>, where they’ll be reviewed, refined, and eventually
        merged into <code>main</code> during the monthly sync.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once submitted, your contribution will go through a review process.<br>
        Maintainers may suggest improvements, ask questions, or request changes to ensure clarity, originality, and
        alignment with GoDarda's philosophy.<br>
        This collaborative review helps maintain the quality and professionalism of the project—and it's a great way to
        learn and grow together.
