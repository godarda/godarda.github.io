<div class="board"><div class="boardtitle">1. Website Visitors</div>
    <p>Like most website operators, GoDarda collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. GoDarda's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how GoDarda's visitors use its website. From time to time, GoDarda may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
</div>

<div class="board"><div class="boardtitle">2. Security</div>
    <p>The security of your non-personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your non-personal information (visitors count, location, etc.), we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
</div>

<div class="board"><div class="boardtitle">3. Advertisements</div>
    <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by GoDarda and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
