## Project Philosophy

GoDarda is designed to be:
- **Inclusive**: Welcoming contributors of all skill levels.
- **Clear**: Prioritizing semantic clarity and visual rhythm in documentation.
- **Empowering**: Recognizing contributors meaningfully without clutter.
- **Minimalist**: Every addition should serve clarity, not complexity.

## Our Mission

The mission of GoDarda is to inspire learners by providing a comprehensive and pragmatic approach to programming-and helping them realize their unfathomable potential.

Every contribution you make brings us closer to that vision.  
Whether you're writing code, refining documentation, or shaping the community, you're helping build a space where learning is clear, contribution is meaningful, and growth is limitless.

Thank you for being part of GoDarda.

## Ways to Contribute

- Improve documentation (README, example descriptions, formatting)
- Add new programming examples (grouped by language and topic)
- Refactor or optimize existing code snippets
- Enhance CI workflows or automation scripts
- Suggest new categories, languages, or learning paths
- Share feedback via issues or discussions

## Project Structure

Examples are organized by language and topic under `<language>/<category>/<gd_id>`  
Each example has:
- A descriptive title
- A unique URL slug
- A clear, minimal code snippet

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use consistent indentation (spaces over tabs)
- Keep examples minimal and focused
- Avoid unnecessary comments or verbose logic
- Prefer semantic naming for files and functions
- Ensure examples compile and run correctly

## Documentation Guidelines

- Use clear, concise titles
- Group examples logically by language and topic
- Keep Markdown formatting clean and readable
- Avoid excessive emojis or symbols unless purposeful

## Original Work Only

All contributions to GoDarda must be **original and authored by you**.

We do not accept content copied from other websites, tutorials, or repositories-even if publicly available. Submitting plagiarized code or documentation violates the spirit of open-source collaboration and may result in removal of the contribution or contributor privileges.

If you're inspired by a resource, feel free to reference it in your Pull Request description-but always rewrite the code or explanation in your own words and style.

> GoDarda is a space for learning, sharing, and growing together. Let's keep it authentic.
