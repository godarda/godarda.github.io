Description:
    Ubuntu convenience helpers for provisioning and running the GoDarda website locally.

    This module provides a small wrapper around system package installation and the
    default startup flow used on Ubuntu-based development hosts or CI runners.
    It intentionally keeps behavior imperative and minimal â€” it invokes system package
    managers (apt/snap) and relies on the shared utilities module for environment
    validation, dependency installation, cleanup and server lifecycle.

    Safety / operational notes:
    - Many commands in this script require elevated privileges (sudo). Run only on
      trusted machines and review commands before execution.
    - This script is tailored to Ubuntu/Debian environments. Do not run on other
      distributions without adjusting package names and package manager calls.
    - The script uses a basic "full" CLI flag and a lightweight internet check to
      decide whether to perform a complete provisioning flow vs. only starting the server.

Usage:
    - Run from the repository root (or let utilities.py change into the repo root).
    - To perform a full provisioning flow: python3 setups/ubuntu.py full
    - To only attempt to start the server: python3 setups/ubuntu.py

def install_packages():

    Install system-level packages required to build and serve the site on Ubuntu.

    Behavior:
    - Performs an apt update and full-upgrade to ensure package metadata is current.
    - Installs a curated list of packages. The list is narrower in CI (githubactions)
      to reduce runtime and avoid interactive installs; for local development a
      broader set of developer tools is installed.
    - Uses snap to install Visual Studio Code and Julia when available on the host
      and not already installed.
    - If not running inside GitHub Actions and the repository is missing locally,
      the repository will be cloned and the working directory adjusted.
    - Delegates Ruby/Python gem and pip installs to install_dependencies() from utilities.

    Important:
    - All apt/snap commands use system calls that will require sudo. The caller of
      this function must be prepared to provide credentials or run the script with sudo.
    - The function deliberately tolerates missing packages via --ignore-missing and
      continues on best-effort.

    - If the "full" CLI flag was provided and basic internet connectivity is available:
