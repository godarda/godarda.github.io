Author: Shubham Darda
Purpose:
    Helper utilities to set up and run the GoDarda static site locally (development/CI).
    This module provides environment validation, dependency installation helpers,
    lightweight cleanup routines and a convenience function to start the Jekyll server.

Guidelines:
    - Keep logic platform-aware (Windows vs POSIX).
    - Keep CLI-friendly behavior: inspect sys.argv for a "full" flag to enable full install/cleanup flows.
    - Minimal external side-effects unless explicitly requested (e.g. deleting git-ignored files when in repo root).
